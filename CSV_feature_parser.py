# This script parses the feature_file and creates CSV file with values from each feature.           #
# This means, the features are segregated according to the cube postion.                            #
# Uses: - The result would later help while running K-Nearest neighbors algorithm.                  #
#                                                                                                   #
# Usage : $python3 CSV_feature_parser.py drone_features.txt                                         #
# Expected ouput format: File of the format CSV_features_compiled.                                  #
# - This file contains features that belong to that particular X-Y-Z position.                      #
